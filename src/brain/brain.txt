tell me about entropy in machine learning|Entropy is a concept used in machine learning as a measure of the impurity or randomness in a dataset. In decision trees and other machine learning algorithms that use entropy, the goal is to find the optimal way to split the data into subsets that are as pure as possible.
|Entropy is calculated based on the proportion of instances in each class within a given subset of the data. If a subset contains only instances of one class, it has zero entropy (i.e., it is pure). If a subset contains an equal proportion of instances from two classes, it has maximum entropy (i.e., it is impure or random).
In decision tree algorithms, the entropy of each possible split is calculated, and the split with the lowest entropy is chosen as the best one to make. The process of recursively splitting the data based on the chosen splits continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a certain level of purity or depth in the tree.|
What Is a Decision Network?|Decision networks are generalized Bayes Belief Networks with chance nodes, decision nodes, and a utility node. These networks are used to make decisions under uncertainty.
