# Chat Bot
## Description
This is a simple chat bot that can respond to user input using pre-defined responses stored in a text file. The chat bot is written in Java and uses the console for input and output.

## Usage
To use the chat bot, simply run the Main class in your Java IDE or compile and run the program from the command line. The chat bot will load its pre-defined responses from the brain/brain.txt file and wait for user input. When the user enters a message, the chat bot will look for a matching response in its pre-defined responses and output that response to the console.

## Features
* Simple console-based chat bot
* Uses pre-defined responses to generate output
* Responses are stored in a text file for easy modification
* New responses can be added to the brain/brain.txt file as needed
* Code is well-organized and easy to read
